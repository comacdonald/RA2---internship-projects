Register to view and submit questions: Debate On DemocracyRegistration: Webinar Registration', \"OTTAWA – Last week, Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May stated: “The RCMP is a racist institution.” Today, Ms. May provided further evidence of the institution’s racist, anti-Indigenous attitude.In 2017, in what was supposed to be a fair and open competition to locate a new RCMP Occupational Communication Centre in Nova Scotia, the RCMP rigged the process to rule out the bid of the Millbrook First Nation.The details of how this was done emerged through Access to Information requests and are laid out in a March 25, 2020 letter from Chief Robert Gloade of Millbrook First Nation to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair (attached).“Surely a claim to respect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires, at a minimum, fair access to economic opportunities,” said Ms. May. “But the RCMP unfairly added an unexplained $1.6 million in costs to the Millbrook proposal, while inaccurately describing the RCMP HQ proposal as involving zero rent.“Over the years I served as leader of the Green Party of Canada, we have called for public inquiries into the RCMP multiple times. Occasionally, a review took place but never with the teeth to allow investigators to get to the facts.”Issues requiring investigations include:RCMP interference in the 2006 election;The RCMP’s militarized approach, including the use of violence against peaceful protesters at Elsipogtog First Nation in New Brunswick in 2013;Systemic sexism in the RCMP and horrific treatment of female officers;What the RCMP knew about the scandal of money laundering in British Columbia casinos;The violent arrest of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs last winter; andThe degree to which racists and those with links to white supremacist organizations have joined the RCMP.“We also need an inquiry into how the RCMP handled the April 2020 mass murder in Nova Scotia that ranged from Portapique to the Wentworth Valley, Debert and Shubenacadie, the killing of Rodney Levi by New Brunswick RCMP, as well as this contract ‘fixing’ to advantage the RCMP proposal and disadvantage Millbrook First Nation,” said Ms. May.“In other words, it is time to place the RCMP under a microscope. I want to know why the RCMP is receiving an unexplained additional $18 million in supplementary estimates on top of its $3.5 billion budget and additional $220 million, to, quite rightly, compensate officers injured on the job. The $18 million is without detail. Now would be a good time to say 'no.'“The collectivity of recent (post-2005) experiences does not inspire confidence. The impression is of an unaccountable, secretive organization. It is time for a thorough review to ask whether this institution is capable of reform.”*Letter to Ministers attached# # #For more information or to arrange an interviewDebra Eindiguer613-240-8921debra@greenparty.caRosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916 ext. 204rosie.emery@greenparty.ca\", 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada has announced the final lineup for its leadership contest – a strong and diverse field of 10 contestants hailing from every region of the country.“I’m very excited about how our leadership contest is shaping up,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “I believe it will generate lots of interest from members and also attract new members who are looking for a more inclusive approach to politics.“Our contestants not only hail from coast to coast to coast, they also reflect the diversity that is our nation’s greatest strength.

Undoubtedly, there will be ongoing discussions and investigations as we unpack the lessons learned and plot our path forward. While this terrible crisis continues to impact Canada and the world, we cannot ignore the present and urgent threat of the climate emergency.“Reimagining Our Future is the policy framework to propel Canada into a new and exciting future. The plan recommits us to restore resilience in the economy, while remembering the primary lesson of the pandemic – that we are all in this together. Underpinning the plan is a long overdue commitment to evidence-based policy and legislation. And, we will renegotiate societal contracts to reflect a more equitable society that respects all citizens.”Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands) said: \"According to a recent poll by Ekos research, 73 per cent of Canadians are looking for transformative change in the post-pandemic recovery. This is a moment of enormous potential. We will not go \\'back to normal\\' if that means normal levels of poverty, inequality, abuse of our elders and polluting industries that must be cleaned up. We must reimagine our future.\"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that governments can act quickly and decisively in response to an emergency. Throughout the crisis, Canadian officials and citizens have adhered to the advice of public health officers. Reimagining Our Future advocates for a Chief Climate Science Officer to regularly update and inform Candians on the climate crisis.Climate scientists have repeatedly warned that insufficient action on climate will lead to runaway global warming. Reimagining Our Future calls for an orderly retreat from fossil fuels to ensure Canadian workers are part of a just transition and that future public investments are consistent with climate goals.Greens applaud the federal government\\'s quick fiscal response to support Canadian citizens and businesses during the pandemic. However, Reimagining Our Future advocates the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) be converted to a permanent Guaranteed Livable Income (GLI).“Canada needs a stronger safety net, one that ensures no one will fall through the cracks. A Guaranteed Livable Income is a fair system that alleviates poverty and rewards work,” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “A single, universal benefit will eliminate the enormous cost of administering the current patchwork of federal and provincial assistance programs. The Green Party has been championing the idea of a GLI for decades. The need for it has never been more clear.”Mr. Manly also pointed out how COVID-19 had exposed the disgraceful conditions in private long-term care facilities, the lack of support for Canadians dealing with mental health issues and many other gaps in our health-care system. Reimagining Our Future calls for de-privatizing long-term care and bringing mental health under the Canada Health Act.“\"It\\'s clear that a national strategy for long-term care is needed,\" said Manly. “Establishing federal standards of care will improve conditions for both seniors in care and the workers who support them. Every loophole or lax regulation that incentivizes operators to wring profit from these facilities through substandard care and substandard working conditions must be removed permanently.”The pandemic has also highlighted the need to rethink work and education. Reimagining Our Future proposes more telecommuting and shorter working hours, both of which will benefit worker well-being and the environment. Eliminating student debt and providing free tuition is crucial as is ensuring that every Canadian has access to fast, reliable internet service.“The last few months of lockdown measures across the nation have taught us how much we value the physical presence of our friends, family, and neighbours,” said Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton). “That desire for community will equip us to stand together through the economic and societal restructuring to come. I am excited by the opportunity to rethink government services and policies to put people first with a focus on well-being. With this foundation, we can create the transformative change we need.”Reimagining Our Future# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Debra Eindiguer613-240-8921debra@greenparty.caRosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916 ext, 204rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada has accepted the nomination of Judy N Green as a contestant for the party’s leadership.Voting will take place from September 26 to October 3, online and by mail-in ballot.

His recent comments have increased the risk of violence.“With Prime Minister Trudeau accepting the hard reality that racism persists in Canada, it is essential that we hold a full inquiry to determine to what extent white supremacist organizations are infiltrating our own law enforcement agencies and the Canadian Armed Forces.“In 2006, the FBI warned that white supremacist groups were urging members to become police officers to blend in and covertly advance their racist cause,” said Ms. May. “That 2006 warning from the FBI appears to have been ignored. We cannot afford to ignore the threat. If indeed, white supremacists are joining the police forces and the military it would explain why we are seeing more acts of violence and killings of black men and women perpetrated by law enforcement officers, few of whom face charges. Indigenous people in Canada are also disproportionately experiencing violence, and even death, at the hands of law enforcement.“CSIS has confirmed that there are white supremacist groups in Canada. We need to recognize them for the terrorists that they are. If there is one thing worse than a white supremacist with a gun, it’s a white supremacist with a gun and in uniform.”In 2019, the Liberal government added two international neo-Nazi groups to Canada\\'s list of outlawed terrorist organizations as part of a series of new measures to combat online hate. A 2019 study conducted by Universite de Montreal criminologist Massimiliano Mulone, Universite du Quebec, Montreal sociologist Victor Armory and Mariam Hassaoui, a sociologist from Universite TELUQ, found \"systemic bias\" by Montreal police, but stopped short of saying that officers were engaged in racial profiling.Green caucus justice critic Jenica Atwin, (MP, Fredericton) said: “It’s terrifying to think of police entities harbouring white supremacists, especially knowing what we know about over representation of black and Indigenous people in the prison system, and how many die during police interventions.“Hate must be weeded out. We need systemic restructuring to vet for white supremacy, along with misogyny and xenophobia. And these attitudes must be denounced by all leaders including the President of the United States.”“There’s no reason to think that Canadian law enforcement agencies, or armed forces personnel, are immune to infiltration,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts.”Earlier this year we learned that former Canadian Forces engineer Patrik Matthews had been arrested by the FBI on firearms charges and was accused of being a member of a violent neo-Nazi group. A full inquiry would be a proactive step to ensure this is not happening here, and at the same time, help to provide Canadians in racialized communities with more confidence in our law enforcement agencies.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Contact:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916 ext, 204rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', \"OTTAWA – On the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Green Party of Canada is speaking out against China’s latest move to quell Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.“Canada must stand with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Legal and human rights experts warn that the new National Security Law passed by the People’s National Congress last month will allow authorities to silence government critics and severely limit freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and equality before the law.“Last year’s pro-democracy protests brought two million people onto the streets to be met with water cannon, tear gas, rubber bullets, and even live ammunition. The new National Security Law is Beijing’s bid to stamp out democracy in Hong Kong once and for all.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted Canada’s short-sighted attitude towards trade with China,” said Green Party critic for international trade and investment, Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “The Green Party has criticized past Liberal and Conservative governments for opening up trade and investment with China without any requirement for the Chinese government to improve human rights, the rule of law or allow for the development of democratic institutions.“The Harper Conservatives signed a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPPA) with China as an Order in Council, without any debate in Parliament. This lopsided agreement gives Chinese companies, including state-owned corporations, extraordinary powers to challenge the democratic decisions of Canada’s government in private and secretive Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) tribunals. Unlike other FIPPA agreements, this one is locked in for 15 years. Under this agreement, the PRC has the ability to threaten financial penalties in secret meetings. Such pressure can be brought to bear in secret, potentially impacting our government's response to the deteriorating situation for Hong Kong.“Canada must develop foreign investment and trade policies that protect Canadian interests from China’s aggressive trade and diplomatic tactics. Canada should follow Australia’s example and create a foreign agent registry to investigate foreign influence on Canadian public and private institutions. Many Chinese-Canadian citizens who support the pro-democracy movement have reported increased influence and interference from the Chinese state here in Canada.”“As we witness a new round of protests by pro-democracy students and civil society groups in Hong Kong, we are also witnessing a new crackdown on demonstrators,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich Gulf Islands).“Amnesty International has warned that China could very soon ban dual Chinese-Canadian citizens from leaving Hong Kong. Canada must act now to assist Canadian citizens who wish to leave Hong Kong and return to Canada.

The pain and suffering caused by human trafficking is alleviated in part by the heroic work of local organizations, who are dedicated to supporting and protecting women facing human trafficking.That is why, Opposition parties are calling on the government to reverse their decision to allow the expiry of funding specifically dedicated to helping these organizations deliver programming to help victims and survivors of human trafficking. Without this funding, organizations will no longer be able to offer their specialized assistance to these women and girls, who are made even more vulnerable due to the ongoing pandemic.The letter in its entirety can be found below.# # #For more information, please contact:Scott BandyOffice of Karen Vecchio, MPkaren.vecchio@parl.gc.ca613-990-7769', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada has accepted the nomination of Dylan Perceval-Maxwell as a contestant for the party’s leadership.The new leader will be chosen at a national convention to be held in Charlottetown P.E.I. in October, replacing Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands) who stepped down in November after 13 years in the positionIn the early 90s, Dylan studied climate variability at McGill University in Montreal, launched three organic food co-ops, his first “eco-store” selling organic cotton and hemp clothing, and became well known for running his car on used vegetable oil.Dylan initiated several environmental projects including an early pilot project using a biodieseldiesel blend to reduce C02 emissions and improve air quality.

Border and travel restrictions, physical distancing and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry will all have a negative impact on the sector for months, perhaps years. Along with large corporations, thousands of small family businesses from coast to coast to coast may never recover.“It’s essential that we provide sustainable support that is specifically targeted to the tourism industry,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) was a welcome step during this crisis. However, as the provinces slowly begin to open up, it's highly unlikely that the tourism industry will be able to recover any time soon. People may be more cautious about travelling due to concerns about COVID-19. We need long-term assurances for the tourism sector that will enable them to survive through the winter and have the support needed to succeed next spring and summer.“As it stands now, CEWS is still not adequate for many businesses to re-hire their employees. Expanding the program until the end of August is a positive step but it’s not enough. Some of the organizations in my constituency want CEWS to be extended for 18 months. After payroll and taxes the program is simply not enough to support a company with competitive salaries. We must do more to avoid one of Canada’s most important industries being decimated. Small businesses are the engine of our economy and they need more help.”The tourism sector employs about 1.8 million Canadians and contributed about $34 billion to Canada’s GDP in the first nine months of 2018. The sector has also seen a shift towards sustainable tourism in recent years.“Ensuring that the tourism sector is well-equipped to bounce back as we move into the recovery phase from this crisis is vital to Canada's economy,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “We will also need to provide support to municipalities since they too are affected by loss of municipal tax revenues. It’s all connected. When the tourism sector suffers, that impacts the whole community.”Ms. Roberts points out that businesses will have to maintain public health requirements and physical distancing measures adding an extra financial burden.“Tourism stimulates our economy, provides jobs, encourages interprovincial cooperation, improves Canada’s reputation on the world stage and educates Canadians and visitors about our heritage,” said Ms. Roberts. “In every province and territory of this great country the tourism sector sustains thousands of Canadians and we must ensure that they can survive, and thrive again.”\", 'OTTAWA - Mental health professionals are warning of an echo-pandemic of mental illness to follow in the wake of COVID-19. Green critic for health Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton) is calling for immediate investments in community mental health services.“The gaps in mental health services before the pandemic were massive. We were already facing a mental health crisis and then COVID-19 came along,” said Atwin. “The pandemic has been unlike anything we’ve experienced, exposing Canadians in all walks of life to new anxieties, robbing them of the comfort of family and friends, leaving them financially insecure. It is hitting people hard.”Last week, Dr. Simon Sherry, a psychologist in Nova Scotia, said that he has seen more suicide attempts in the last three months than he has seen in five years.“We are already seeing the toll this pandemic is taking on people but mental health professionals are warning that this is the tip of the iceberg, that we should be preparing for an echo-pandemic of mental illness,” said Atwin. “In other words, we need to act now.”Over a month ago, the Canadian Mental Health Association called for immediate investment in the scale-up of cost-effective, evidence-based community mental health programs and supports. Atwin added her voice to this call in a letter to Health Minister Patty Hajdu yesterday.“What’s the hold-up? Hotlines are great, but we need to do more,” said Atwin. “Immediate investments to community organizations and municipal or provincial mental health services are essential to help these services prepare for what’s to come.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interviewDebra Eindiguer613-240-8921debra@greenparty.caShannon CarmontChief of Staff to Ms. Atwin506-440-4980shannon.carmont.253@parl.gc.ca', \"OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is urging the federal government to open a national inquiry into the horrific tragedy that has unfolded in Canadian long-term care homes, during the COVID-19 crisis.“The terrible toll this pandemic has taken on residents of long-term care facilities could have been reduced had the right protocols and oversight been in place,” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith).“I have spoken on the issue of substandard care in privately-owned and operated long-term care facilities multiple times in the House of Commons. In July of last year, I flagged concerns around foreign ownership of these facilities in a letter to Ministers Navdeep Bains and Ralph Goodale. In January this year I spoke about the need for major changes in how seniors’ care residences are operated, and in early March I addressed the issue again, stating that we had failed to protect seniors. Sadly, we have now witnessed the terrible consequences of our inaction.“While the COVID-19 crisis has brought much needed attention to what has been happening in long-term care institutions, it's tragic that more lives had to be lost under deplorable conditions in order for that to happen,” said Manly. “In light of this, the Green caucus calls on the federal government to initiate a national inquiry into long-term care homes to ensure that Canadian seniors are properly protected. Given that these facilities fall under provincial jurisdiction, a national inquiry would be an opportune moment to initiate federal oversight through a regulatory body.”The National Institute on Aging stated May 6 that 3,436 residents and six staff members of long-term care facilities had died of COVID-19, representing 82 per cent of Canada’s 4,167 deaths reported as of that date. According to Dr. Samir Sinha, research director at the NIA,Canada has the highest proportion of deaths from COVID-19 in long term-care settings among 14 countries being tracked in a study by the International Long-Term Care Policy Network. A May 8 investigation by the Toronto Star revealed that four times as many deaths occurred in the for-profit long-term care facilities, than in the non-profit facilities.“This is a tragic wake up call for Canadians and we must do everything possible to ensure this can never happen again,”said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “The other issue here that must be addressed going forward is the part-time hours and inadequate wages paid to long-term care workers, forcing many caregivers to work two jobs to make ends meet. These are essential workers, many of whom are women, some new immigrants, all risking their lives to care for elders, who built the society we now enjoy.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca\", 'OTTAWA – Green Party MPs are urging the federal government to uphold its obligations to the international community, and work to advance human rights, climate action and stability between nations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"The climate emergency cannot be postponed,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “Despite dramatic declines in pollution levels globally, the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise. We are disturbed by comments from Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson that key climate commitments and other long-overdue regulations will be delayed. The climate crisis poses a threat to human civilization that is far more severe than COVID-19. It is a slower moving, but much larger looming catastrophe.”The Paris agreement requires that Canada dramatically improve its target, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), within calendar year 2020. The decision to postpone the planned climate negotiations in Glasgow (COP26) until next year does not affect the requirement to deliver a new target to the UNFCCC secretariat in 2020.Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) said that during the global pandemic it is more important than ever that Canada show leadership on human rights. “We are very disappointed that the government lifted the moratorium on arms exports to Saudi Arabia in April,” said Manly. “Saudi Arabia has been accused of war crimes in the conflict in Yemen. There is evidence of Canadian-made light armoured vehicles being used there. Saudi Arabia also has an atrocious record of human rights abuses against women and religious minorities within its own borders.”The Green Party is also calling on the federal government to oppose Israel’s plan to illegally annex settlements in the West Bank. Green MPs havewritten to the prime minister urging the government to take a strong stance against any annexation of Palestinan lands, which would be a clear violation of International Law, the Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolution 242 (UNSC 242).“Canada must not stand idly by and allow Israel to violate international law with impunity,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly affirmed his support for a two-state solution. The Green Party urges the federal government to raise this matter with Canada’s international partners, and pressure Israel to back down from this dangerous plan.”“As the world works through the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic it is critical not to lose sight of the other collective challenges humanity faces: climate change, human rights and global peace and security.

We know that the Indigenous populations are particularly vulnerable and we must ensure that they are protected.”Green Party Deputy Leader Daniel Green is urging local public health officials to consider the risks of COVID-19 transmission in the epidemiological context of high-density campgrounds.“There are over 2,000 campgrounds in Quebec and Ontario,” said Mr. Green. “The concentration and physical proximity of campers could potentially trigger widespread transmission of COVID-19. The communal use of sanitary and recreational facilities lends itself to such a risk. In addition, the urban clientele of these campgrounds could potentially trigger an increase in rural outbreaks of the disease.”The Green Party calls on the public health departments of Quebec and Ontario to require campground operators to implement preventative measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at their sites.“If the provincial public health departments consider it impossible to ensure safety measures are in place for the 2020 season, then we urge the federal government to work with the provinces to provide a compensation package to impacted owners,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “This is urgent.

What the Green Party wants to see is investments in public infrastructure rather than stimulus spending on P3s and private infrastructure ,” said MP Paul Manly Green caucus critic for labour, employment, workforce development and disability inclusionA recent report by Nobel winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and renowned British climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, based on interviews with over 200 experts from central banks and economists from G20 countries, found that investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency will create a large number of jobs in the short term while we are in a recession and jobs are scarce. Investments in fossil fuels could stall economic recovery.One key piece of infrastructure the Green Party proposes is the construction of an east-west and north-south electricity grid that would connect the provinces and territories. The grid would maximize each region’s renewable energy capacity. “It’s important that new infrastructure projects remain publicly owned to realize the full value of taxpayers' investments,” said Manly. “The sale of Hwy 407 in Ontario is a cautionary tale that should be heeded. That highway cost $1.5 billion to build and was then sold in 1999 for $3.1 billion to a Spanish multinational corporation. It’s now valued as high as $28 billion and this corporate owned ‘cash cow’ costs Ontario drivers almost a billion dollars each year to use.”Another spending priority identified in the Stern-Stiglitz report that delivers a high number of jobs per dollar is energy retrofits of older buildings. “Energy retrofit programs directed towards lower income households would decrease social and health inequality by shrinking real electricity costs and keep houses warm in the winter,” Manly noted. “If we want to reward our low-wage frontline workers, providing energy efficient homes would be a good way to do that and save them money.”MP Atwin (Fredericton) sees potential in federal funds supporting provincial infrastructure. “Investing in health care and long term care infrastructure are both badly needed across the nation, and these facilities can be among the first to see widespread energy efficiency retrofits,” said Jenica Atwin, Green caucus critic for health. “After witnessing the tragedy in private long term facilities it’s clear that these facilities should also be publicly owned.”“As we craft the economic recovery from COVID-19, we have a unique opportunity to combine fiscal investments with climate responsibility,” said Elizabeth May, Green parliamentary leader. “The ideas that these experts are bringing forward - leading economists, scientists and innovators - need to be heeded the same way we listen to the health authorities. There is a path forward through this Covid-19 crisis and through the climate emergency that will leave a lasting legacy of a liveable planet for our children and grandchildren.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca\", 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is disturbed by recent reports that Israel’s new coalition government intends to annex significant parts of the West Bank Palestinian territories, occupied by Israel since 1967.“If this goes ahead, it will represent one of the single most extreme unilateral moves made by Israel in recent decades in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith), the Green caucus critic on foreign affairs. “An annexation of Palestinian lands in the midst of the global COVID-19 crisis would not only violate UN Security Council resolution 242 (UNSC 242) but several other resolutions as well. It would also end all hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”UNSC 242 refers to the \"inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security.\"Mr. Manly points out that the area targeted in the annexation plan includes occupied lands in the Jordan River valley. “Taking such reckless action would threaten Israel’s quarter-century-old peace agreement with Jordan,” he said. “It would undermine the stability of the government of Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who is already under intense internal political pressures. Weakening the Jordanian government and ending Jordan’s peace with Israel would further destabilize the entire Middle East region.”During a visit to Ukraine in 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau condemned Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its failure to abide by the Minsk Accord. Two years earlier, in 2014, Canada imposed sanctions in response to the Russian occupation and annexation of Crimea.“The Green Party caucus has written to the prime minister asking him to apply the same principles cited by successive Canadian administrations in regard to the Russian occupation and annexation of Crimea, to any Israeli plan to annex further occupied Palestinian territories,” said Mr. Manly.Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May is on the executive of the Canada-Palestinian Parliamentary Friendship Group. \"I am deeply concerned with the plight of the Palestinian people in this time of pandemic,” said Ms. May. ‘It is unacceptable that Israel would attempt to use COVID-19 as cover for further compromising the long term security of the region.\"“Canada must not stand idly by and allow Israel to violate international law with impunity,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly affirmed his support for a two-state solution.

An increase to current funding would benefit more employers, more students and young people, as well as helping to meet essential needs in local communities across Canada.“The Canada Summer Jobs program is over-subscribed all across the country,” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith), the party’s caucus critic for labour and social development. “Here in Nanaimo-Ladysmith there were almost twice as many applications from employers as the funding covered.”Mr. Manly points out that recent changes to the CSJ program qualify private businesses for 100 per cent wage subsidy, a benefit that previously only applied to non-profits. In addition, some job placements have been extended to February next year. The higher private sector grants and longer duration of some placements means that in a time of greater need there are actually fewer jobs than usual.“There are non-profit organizations and businesses in my riding, and across Canada, who are dealing with an increased demand for their services because of the public health crisis,” said Mr. Manly. “They would benefit from having more students working with them this summer. With additional CSJ funding we can create more jobs for young people, especially those who urgently need a job and don’t qualify for emergency benefits.”Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton) confirmed that the CSJ funding does not match the needs of her community.“In my riding alone there are over 100 private and community organizations who will receive nothing this year, many of whom rely on this funding for their operations every summer,”said Ms. Atwin. “Donations are down. Customers have dwindled. Private sector summer employment is scarce for students. The Canada Summer Jobs program is the perfect vehicle to step up and pump more funding for student jobs into communities across the nation.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is calling on Finance Minister Bill Morneau and the federal government to ensure that any taxpayer bailout for the airline industry is contingent on full cash refunds for COVD-19 cancellations. Green MPs are receiving numerous complaints from constituents who are unable to obtain reimbursement for flights booked before the lockdown. Instead passengers are being offered vouchers. In many cases these vouchers expire after 11 months or even less from the date of the cancellation.The Canadian Transport Agency (CTA) has indicated that the use of vouchers could be a reasonable approach in the case of COVID-19, when passengers have no option to complete their itineraries. However, the American and European legislative frameworks include a minimum requirement for airlines to issue refunds when flights are cancelled for reasons outside their control.“Offering passengers a time-sensitive voucher to rebook airline tickets cancelled due to pandemic travel restrictions is not good enough,” said Green parliamentary leader and caucus transport critic Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “Considering that European and American airlines have taken into consideration the extraordinary circumstance instigated by the pandemic, it would be fitting if Canadian companies would follow suit. We do not know when international travel will open up again. Even when it does, given the very real possibility of a second and even a third wave of this pandemic, people may not feel safe travelling for quite some time.“My caucus colleagues and I have received numerous complaints from our constituents on this matter. I urge Minister Morneau to address the situation as quickly as possible,” said Ms. May. “I would also like to suggest that this would be an opportune time for the government to insist that Canadian airlines adopt climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. As we move into the recovery phase from this pandemic, let’s ensure all businesses are in line with the green economy of the future.”Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts said that the airline industry has been hit hard by this crisis but, like other large corporations, has been able to benefit from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).“While we appreciate the timely implementation of federal government aid programs, the reality is that many Canadians and businesses are still hurting financially due to this crisis,” said Ms. Roberts. “Greens feel strongly that there should be no government bailout of the airlines until passengers affected by COVID-19 are given refunds. It’s the right thing to do.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', 'OTTAWA – As provinces begin to ease the restrictions of the pandemic lockdown, the Green Party of Canada is urging federal and provincial health authorities to recommend low-tech measures – such as wearing face masks in public – successfully employed in other countries to limit the spread of COVID-19.Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) has been following developments in Taiwan where his brother is a teacher. “Given that Taiwan has pretty much avoided any kind of lockdown, I think it merits us taking a closer look at what they are doing right,” he said.“Taiwan learned critical lessons from the SARS epidemic, so when COVID-19 threatened to engulf their country, they invoked the precautionary principle and prepared for the worst,” said Manly. “They already had a stockpile of masks in case of a pandemic, but in early February they ramped up domestic production of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks and hand sanitizer for the general public.”In early February Taiwan was listed in the top 10 countries with COVID-19 outbreaks. By May 4, Taiwan had dropped to number 122 with 438 cases and six deaths. In contrast, Canada is at number 12 with 61,422 cases and 3,891 deaths. Taiwan has a population of 23.78 million, the 57th largest country in the world in terms of population, and the 17th most densely populated.While the wearing of face masks is not mandatory, it is encouraged through voluntary cooperation. Chang Shan-chwen, a specialist with Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center, says that masks are a significant factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19 with the odds of transmitting the disease dropping by 99 per cent if both infected and non-infected persons wear masks.”“They put strategies in place that they hoped would enable citizens to continue daily life with minimal disruptions and in their case, it seems to have paid off,” said Mr. Manly. “The students my brother teaches missed two weeks of school after their winter break but they are all back in class now. My brother and his students wear masks in class and the students use plexiglass shields on their desks while they eat their lunches. Parents take the temperature of children every morning before they go to school, and keep them home if their temperature has increased.”“Our first priority with PPE must continue to be providing supplies to frontline and essential workers,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Many European Union countries are asking people to wear simple cloth masks when in public spaces. Some airlines, including Air Canada, require all passengers to wear them. Since we’re probably in this for the long haul, it seems like a simple, but effective strategy to encourage here in Canada as well.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', \"OTTAWA – The Green Party is calling on the government to do more to counter misogyny amid reports of increasing rates of domestic and gender-based violence across the country.This week the Minister for Women and Gender Equality, Maryam Monsef, said that front-line organizations are reporting a 20 to 30 per cent increase in rates of gender-based violence and domestic violence in some regions of the country. This comes on the heels of the tragic killings in Nova Scotia that began with the assault of the killer’s intimate partner.“We have a misogyny problem in this country,” said Green MP Jenica Atwin (Fredericton), the Green caucus critic for women and gender equality. “It is deeply-seeded in the fabric of our communities and to counter it we are going to need to call it out at the highest levels. We need a national action plan to address intimate partner and gender-based violence.”Earlier this month the government announced $50 million dollars in funding to assist women's shelters, sexual assault centres and similar facilities in Indigenous communities during the pandemic. The Green Party is also urging the government to maintain predictable funding after the pandemic so that community organisations can provide consistent support to their clients.“Fighting the pandemic has meant we have all been asked to stay at home,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “For many of us, home evokes warmth and security.

According to the FCM’s latest report, many are being pushed to the brink of financial crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FCM President Bill Karsten stated: “With new expenses, staggering drops in revenue and no freedom to run deficits, municipalities need emergency funding to keep essential services going.”“A lot of small business owners have been asking local mayors and councils to provide deferrals for property tax and for service costs for water, waste water and garbage,” said Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “I’ve also heard from small business owners that municipalities are cancelling contracts with them. In one case a local farm and nursery in my riding has had contracts for plants cancelled. Contract cancellations like this end up cascading as businesses can’t pay their suppliers. Owners are forced to choose between paying bills and going bankrupt themselves.”The FCM estimates that municipal transit systems are incurring monthly losses of about $400 million due to diminished ridership, part of at least $10-15 billion dollars in near-term, non-recoverable losses due to COVID-19. “A bailout package for municipalities could help them to defer tax and service fees while maintaining existing contract commitments,\" said Mr. Manly. \"These measures will help a lot of Canadians and small businesses while ensuring that municipalities can continue to provide essential services including police, fire, water, sewerage and waste management.”The FCM is calling for at least $10 billion in emergency operating funding, including $7.6 billion in direct federal allocations to all municipalities, plus $2.4 billion for those with transit systems. Additional funds would be needed for municipalities facing added challenges supporting isolation guidelines for vulnerable populations.“Toronto alone is facing a shortfall of $2.76 billion in 2020 due to the pandemic,” said Tim Grant, the Green Party’s urban affairs and housing critic. ”Without federal support, cities will have to lay off large numbers of staff or dramatically boost property taxes. Both options will deepen the crises that cities face. By contrast, if cities receive needed emergency operating funding, they will be able to lead the recovery. Our cities are ideally positioned to get fast results from investments in social services and public infrastructure.”“Given the unprecedented times we are in, and the extraordinary financial measures that have already been taken by the federal government to help citizens and businesses navigate this pandemic, let’s not overlook the importance of protecting municipalities,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Cities, towns and communities across Canada are the bedrock of our economic development. As we prepare for the recovery phase of this crisis we must ensure that they too are safeguarded from financial calamity.”', 'NANAIMO – Green Party caucus critic for agriculture and agri-food, Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith) warns that food security both at home and abroad is in serious jeopardy.Manly said that events surrounding the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPEs) during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate how supply chains that stretch halfway across the planet can prove deadly in times of crisis. There are already signs that food production is decreasing while demand remains high.This week, the head of the UN World Food Program warned that the world is \"on the brink of a hunger pandemic\" that could lead to \"multiple famines of biblical proportions\" within a few months if immediate action isn\\'t taken. In Canada, the closure of the Cargill meat plant south of Calgary due to a coronavirus outbreak among workers has exposed the fragility of domestic farm production and supply. On Tuesday, the Trudeau administration announced that they would be curtailing beef exports so as to meet Canadian food demands.“The reality is that here on Vancouver Island we would only have a three-day food supply if the ferries stopped running,” said Manly. “It’s a sobering thought. This pandemic is showing us where weaknesses lie, in supply chain management, in the centralization of processing, and societal deficiencies. As we unpack the lessons learned from this crisis and move into the recovery phase, we must seek opportunities to decentralize food production and processing to strengthen food security here in Canada.”Manly said that over the past several years, trade conflicts and changing environmental conditions have presented a challenging decision-making environment to farmers. Now the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the arrival of temporary foreign workers, creating the new problem of how to plant and manage crops with a drastically reduced workforce.“Add to the mix flooding, droughts and wildfires brought on by the climate emergency and it is not hard to imagine how quickly Canada’s food supply chain could be interrupted, at grave risk to Canadians,” he said.Statistics Canada reports that in 2018 temporary foreign workers (TFW) came from more than 100 countries to fill 54,734 jobs on 3,846 farms, primarily in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The majority (65 per cent) worked on large farms ($2 million or more in revenue). This week the CBC reported that many Canadians farmers are worried that the delayed arrival of TFWs due to COVID-19 could result in diminished production, potential food shortages and higher prices for consumers.“It’s time to revisit our approach to farming and agriculture in Canada,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Here in the maritimes fruit growers were hit by a devastating frost in 2018, then Hurricane Dorian hit in September and now planting is being delayed by the wait for TFWs.”“These climate challenges are only going to get worse, which is why we need to adapt fast. While the large agro-business model has provided us with an abundant supply of food to date, now is the time to invest in smaller, local, organic farming operations across the country. In this way provinces and territories can prepare to localize production and supply as much as possible, so that in an emergency they can be more self-sufficient.”Canada’s 2016 Census of Agriculture showed a three per cent increase in the total number of young farm operators across the country – the first increase since 1991.“As older generations of farmers retire, we need to support and encourage young farmers to step in,” said Manly. “As we do that, let’s grasp the opportunity to promote and incentivize more sustainable farming practices that will ultimately provide a stronger, healthier and more resilient supply chain.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada has accepted the nomination of Amita Kuttner as a contestant for the party’s leadership.The new leader will be chosen at a national convention, currently scheduled to be held in Charlottetown P.E.I. in October, and will replace Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands) who stepped down in November, 2019 after 13 years in the position.Amita Kuttner (theythem) is co-founder of the Moonlight Institute, a non-profit organization that seeks to create a framework for an equitable and just future.

All MPs are equal, just as their constituencies and constituents are equal.”Manly said that under existing provincial quarantine orders, members from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador could not participate in House sittings without undergoing a 14-day quarantine, isolated from their families, upon returning home.“Quebec members have also been asked by their government not to travel. The idea of a small number of MPs meeting in Ottawa violates their privileges and offends the efforts of the Quebec government.”The Green Party opposes any proposal to reintroduce regular sittings of parliament until public health advice makes it possible for every member to attend. Parliament should reconvene only when it needs to debate and vote on urgent legislation.Green MPs urge the Speaker to pursue a virtual Question Period without delay.“Businesses across the country have demonstrated leadership, shifting their workspaces online to respect social distancing,” said Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton). “The House of Commons should be no different.

Andrew Scheer may be willing to put his desire for media coverage ahead of public health, but I think that Canadians expect a better example from their elected representatives.”Ms. May said that MPs from all parties have been given abundant opportunity to provide input to the pandemic relief effort through the committees established by the government. “The government has been very open to ideas and criticisms and has shown itself willing to act on our proposals. The system is working and, as we do this work, we demonstrate the value of dispensing with partisanship and collaborating towards a common goal.”Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) said that the proposed regular sittings would not be in the interests of democracy, as its proponents claim.“Having a small group of MPs in Ottawa does not represent the country as a whole,” he said. “We need a system that gives all MPs the opportunity to represent their communities and regions.

Greens propose the work be undertaken in partnership with First Nations, and wherever possible, capturing renewable green energy through geothermal electricity.”In February’s pre-budget submission to finance minister Bill Morneau, the Green Party underscored the fact that environmental remediation and restoration in the fossil fuel sector is labour intensive not capital intensive. The Green Party submission pointed out that if subsidies were shifted to the labour portions of remediation costs, the funds would have a significantly greater effect on employment and would encourage employers to spend on remediation while still in operations, rather than, as seems likely given history, to default on such liabilities in bankruptcy.“We are in a climate emergency, and so these commitments are encouraging as they will help us prepare for the much more aggressive targets required under the terms of the Paris Agreement,” said Ms. May. \"The release today of the shocking efforts of Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), using the excuse of the COVID-19 pandemic to roll-back environmental and climate actions, as well as lobbying rules, should give all Canadians a sense of relief that CAPP is not calling the shots.”Green caucus critic for labour, employment, workforce development and disability inclusion, Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith) affirmed that subsidizing the cleanup of orphaned and abandoned oil wells is the first step towards a just transition for oil and gas workers. “Workerswho are the casualties of an international price and supply war do need relief,” said Manly.“After the mess left behind by the oil industry is cleaned up these workers need opportunities to use their skills in the transition to a new energy economy. Iron and Earth, an organization formed by former fossil fuel workers, has identified that most energy workers could easily transition to the creation of renewable energy infrastructure such as an east-west electrical grid and geothermal, wind, solar and tidal generation.”“Let’s face it,” concluded Manly, “fossil fuel corporations have been dining on Canadian resources and dashing on the clean up bill for decades.”Greens have long urged the federal government to focus on the economic opportunities that come with the shift to the Green economy and to ensure that there is a “just transition” for fossil fuel workers. Mission Possible - the Green Climate Action Plan outlines a clear and comprehensive strategy to transition towards a zero-carbon economy through the creation of new industries and well-paid jobs.“COVID-19 is understandably on everyone’s mind right now, and we must continue to focus our efforts on doing everything we can to help Canadians get through this difficult time financially, safely and responsibly,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Today’s news that the government will bring some economic relief to fossil fuel workers, while at the same time committing to our climate goals, is welcome indeed.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is concerned by an increase in Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2018, as outlined in the national inventory report submitted to the United Nations this week by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Canada recorded 729 million tonnes of GHG emissions for 2018, up 15 million tonnes from 2017.“Obviously during this unprecedented time, when all our efforts must focus on the human health threat posed by COVID-19, it may seem inappropriate to raise climate concerns,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “But this news, that Canada’s efforts as of the end of 2018 are failing, must be flagged. Given that emissions went up in 2018, our post-COVID climate plans must be far more aggressive. We need to maintain our \\'all hands on deck approach\\' to the pandemic to address the climate challenge. We must prioritize investments in a low-carbon recovery.\"ECCC is responsible for developing and reporting reliable, accurate and timely GHG inventories as part of its obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Ms. May points out that under the terms of the Paris Agreement, Canada should have submitted a new emissions target – known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC) – earlier this year. “Even though COP26 has been postponed to 2021, Canada\\'s improved target is due in 2020. February 9 was the deadline for Canada and other countries to submit their NDCs. Unfortunately, Canada did not meet that deadline and we are now in the midst of a pandemic that is understandably drawing on all our resources. However, to be responsible and bear our fair share, we must reduce our GHGs to 60 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. I hope that once we are able to refocus our attention back to the climate emergency, all government departments will increase their efforts to incorporate stronger climate adaptation to their portfolios.”Mission Possible - the Green Climate Action Plan outlines a robust path forward for a just and fair transition to a green economy.“As we emerge from this pandemic and recovery efforts unfold, a robust plan for a fair and just energy transition will be essential,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “ This offers Canadians a real opportunity to invigorate the clean energy sector which will significantly reduce our emissions and enable us to meet the targets set by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This tragic crisis has reminded us of the importance of national and global collaboration. It has also demonstrated the ability of governments to adapt, and provide strong leadership in a crisis situation. We can use this experience as a template of how to move forward and not go back to our old ways of doing things.”', 'FREDERICTON – At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam warned that Indigenous communities would face disproportionate risks from the virus. Limited access to health care in remote regions, substandard housing, poverty and underlying health conditions are among the issues of concern.Green Party caucus critic for Crown-Indigenous Relations and Indigenous Services,Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton) notes that historic underfunding and institutional racism have left Indigenous communities particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.“The challenges Indigenous communities are facing are complex and varied. There is no one-size-fits-all solution,\" said Atwin. \"What is clear is that the administration of relief programs and government aid needs to be Indigenous-informed and -led. This must include adequate and sustained funding for Friendship Centres and Native Women\\'s Centres as key service providers. The $15M announced by the Federal government so far is totally inadequate. And First Nations communities must be funded, informed, and empowered to protect their membership.\"The Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples recently stated that where Indigenous communities have required suspension of certain activities in their territories, restricting access of workers, tourists, cottagers, and others, this must be respected. However, work on projects such as Coastal GasLink (CGL), the Site C dam, LNG Canada and the Trans Mountain pipeline(TMX) continues, with employees being flown in and out, despite requests by local Indigenous communities to cease these activities. Workers, housed in close quarter on-site camps, pose a serious health risk to nearby Indigenous populations.Lorraine Rekmans, Green Party shadow cabinet critic for Indigenous Affairs, noted the legal nature of Indigenous people’s rights in Canada: “This includes a commitment to free, prior and informed consent on any actions that impact Indigenous communities,” said Rekmans. “Canada’s priority must be to work in partnership with communities to protect Indigenous citizens from any risk, including the risk of community transmission from workers who are entering Indigenous territories.”Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts added: “Not only do we need to respect the authority of Indigenous communities over their territory now, but we need to ensure that they are at the centre of decision-making and planning as Canada rebuilds, and the global economy starts rolling again in the coming weeks and months. Indigenous peoples must no longer be treated as an afterthought in Canadian decision making.”', 'OTTAWA – A spate of tragedies at seniors’ homes and long-term care facilities across Canada highlight the need for the federal government to create and enforce a national standard for both public and private institutions caring for the elderly. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam has revealed that about half the COVID-19 related deaths in Canada are linked to outbreaks at such facilities.“Regulations covering senior homes and long-term care facilities fall under provincial jurisdiction but it is becoming obvious there is a leadership role in this for the federal government.” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “This pandemic has revealed issues of gross negligence and inequality when it comes to the management and hiring practices in these residences. Ownership changes of privatized facilities led to contract flipping and union decertification. Workers were laid off and then re-hired part-time for lower wages and no benefits. These health care workers then had to work at multiple homes to make ends meet and this has led to the spread of COVID-19 from one long-term care facility to another.”Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) was alerted about a seniors home in his riding that was understaffed and providing substandard care. Nanaimo Seniors Village was one of 23 facilities owned by Retirement Concepts which was purchased by the Chinese corporation Anbang Insurance with federal approval. Anbang was taken over by the Chinese state after the CEO was convicted of corruption. The Vancouver Island Health Authority took control of three Retirement Concepts facilities after conditions deteriorated for the seniors living there.Last month, Mr. Manly spoke on the issue in parliament. “Seniors went for weeks without receiving a bath,” said Mr. Manly. “They were left in soiled clothes and soiled beds. Bedsores and other related health consequences of neglect were common.“We have failed to protect seniors,” he added. “We must remove the financial incentive to provide substandard care. Corporations cannot be permitted to squeeze profit out of the healthcare system through vague accounting, paying below-average wages and neglecting vulnerable seniors. The abuses that have resulted from this are horrifying.\"Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands) noted that the Government has a duty to ensure that citizens can live fulfilling and dignified lives in their senior years. She said: “The federal issue now in this pandemic is to review wage subsidy and other rules to recognize that not-for-profit homes for seniors, including those for independent living, urgently need financial support and help getting PPEs. These are the homes most likely to be well-run, but lacking deep pockets to take on additional costs created by COVID-19. We need to address their needs.\"The Green Party advocates for the development of a National Seniors Strategy which would support innovative home-sharing plans and other measures to allow people to stay in their own homes as long as possible.“This is a human rights issue,” said Ms. Roberts. “No one, let alone elders, who’ve built the society we now enjoy, should find themselves trapped in such inhumane conditions. We applaud new measures in B.C. where they are raising wages, and both B.C. and Ontario are mandating that long-term care workers can work at only one home at a time. We hope that similar measures will be introduced across the country and will endure once this pandemic is over. We welcome today’s announcement by the federal government that the salaries of caregivers will be increased, and hope this will become permanent. Eventually, Greens will call for a national inquiry into what has happened here, and for enhanced federal oversight to ensure that it never happens again.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada applauds the cross-party collaboration that resulted in the passage of the Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) bill today. Substantial improvements to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) have been announced as well. Thanks to the hard work of MPs across the country Canadian businesses will receive financial support to keep workers on the payroll during the COVID-19 crisis, and more individual Canadians will soon be eligible for the CERB.\"Honestly, I had a lot of trepidation about traveling to Ottawa to be in Parliament today –. but I am very glad I made it,” said Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “I was able to raise key issues for my constituents, whether small businesses or individuals, who were falling through the cracks.”“As I said in the House, our democracy matters and Canadians need to know that even when all MPs are working from home, we are working. I could not be more proud of the work Jenica Atwin is doing for the people of Fredericton, nor of Paul Manly who helped connect the Deputy Prime minister with the Harmac mill in Nanaimo to help resolve the N-95 mask crisis with the US. It is a time for all hands on deck!\"The $73 billion dollar CEWS bill provides for businesses that have lost 30 percent of their revenue due to COVID-19 to receive a 75 per cent wage subsidy for three months.“I want to echo Elizabeth May\\'s words in the House of Commons,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “We are seeing our government at its best right now. We are grateful that Green voices are being heard. The role of parliament is to serve the common good not just political interest. Democracy works best when politicians work together. I hope this will be a lasting lesson.\"“I’m very pleased to see changes coming to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB),” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “Since CERB was first announced we’ve been advocating in every briefing, and in correspondence with ministers, for an expansion of the program because too many people don’t qualify. It didn’t cover students who can’t get jobs, part-time workers and self-employed owneroperators who have lost significant income but still have some work“In my riding there are essential front-line workers, including a part-time paramedic on Gabriola Island, who lost the majority of their income and need help paying their bills and supporting their families. No one should fall through the gaps in the safety net, so today’s announcements are good news.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is calling on the federal government to urgently recall parliament to pass wage subsidy legislation. The $73 billion dollar package must be approved by the House before relief can start flowing to thousands of Canadian businesses.“Passing this legislation is critical, so if we need to bring a reduced group of MPs back to Ottawa to get it passed, then let’s do it,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). \"We know that C-14 and the expanded 75 per cent wage subsidy does not meet the needs of all. As Greens, we will press for Guaranteed Livable Income as well as flexibility for workers whose needs are not met by CERB. A huge worry for us is the plight of small businesses who see no lifeline in any existing program.\"“Businesses have been shut down for almost a month now. Owners are not only hurting and anxious, but trying to retain employees wherever possible. Green MPs agree that a virtual parliament will be a benefit in the future, but right now we need to move quickly and get this essential relief flowing. The longer it takes, the harder it will be for companies to keep their employees and bounce back once the recovery begins.”House Speaker Anthony Rota concluded this week that a virtual parliament could take up to a month to roll out.“We are delighted to see the collaboration between the federal parties and provincial leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Now is not the time to resume political bickering. This legislation needs to be passed now. And Greens have agreed to have an MP in the House to make it happen. We acknowledge and appreciate the hard work being done behind the scenes to bring much needed relief to millions of Canadians in this unprecedented time. We are optimistic that this emergency legislation can be rolled out within the next week.”', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada has accepted the nomination of David Merner as a contestant for the party’s leadership.The new leader will be chosen at a national convention, currently scheduled to be held in Charlottetown P.E.I. in October, and will replace Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands) who stepped down in November, 2019 after 13 years in the position.David Merner has worked for more than 30 years in law, government, and political activism. Over his 28 years in public service, Mr. Merner provided constitutional, legal and policy advice to ministers in Conservative, Liberal, and NDP governments.

It would have been more fitting for Canada Post to get this contract.”This week the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) said it is concerned that the distribution deal may be rewarding Amazon Canada for creating stressful, precarious jobs by ignoring workers’ demands for health and safety. CUPW pointed out that the decision to work with Amazon was made without consulting postal workers.“The health and safety of Canadian workers must be protected at all times,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts, “but especially during this global public health crisis. We fully support the demands outlined by CUPW and expect the government to put measures in place to ensure the safety of these essential workers.”', \"OTTAWA – The Green Party welcomes the financial relief that Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will bring to many Canadians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, however MPs are pointing to gaping holes in the relief program that will leave many others facing financial hardship.“Too many people fall through the cracks when it comes to the eligibility criteria of the CERB program,” said Green MP Paul Manly (Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “Like the person in my riding who is a part time paramedic. He lost another contract job that he needed to survive. He is not eligible for CERB because he still has some paid work as a paramedic. Or the health care workers with multiple part time jobs at care homes that can now only work at one because of health authority orders. We need frontline workers in these positions to be able do the work we ask of them and not be stressed out about paying rent and feeding their families. Small business owners who pay themselves with a dividend, are also ineligible.”Greens have long advocated implementing a Guaranteed Livable Income program that would replace the current array of income supports, such as disability payments, social assistance and income supplements for seniors.“If we had implemented an Emergency Guaranteed Liveable Income and sent everyone a cheque we could have saved people, civil servants and the system a lot of stress,” said Manly. “The Canada Revenue Agency could have figured out who deserved the funding and who didn’t through the tax system afterwards and taxed back those that didn’t need the extra income. It's not too late to do that.”“So many Canadians like artists and musicians rely on piecemeal employment to make ends meet,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Employment is no longer as easily defined as it was 10 years ago. The CERB eligibility rules exclude far too many of these workers, including self-employed people who have lost contracts but retain a small percentage of their income. They can’t abandon the work that remains but the income is not enough to survive on. Students and seniors whose part time jobs have been cancelled may not be eligible because of the $5,000 minimum income rule. Students who did not have work have no relief programs available to them.”\", 'OTTAWA – The price of a barrel of oil is in free-fall and, while some COVID-19 related issues may be involved, the overwhelming reason is the global glut of cheaper oil caused by the Saudi-Russia price war.Green Party caucus trade critic Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith) points out that Saudi Arabia has the ability to keep prices at levels so low that the barrel itself is worth more than the oil sands bitumen it contains.“The Saudi strategy is to put U.S. Bakken shale producers out of business,” said Manly. “Like oil from Alberta’s oil sands, Bakken shale oil is very polluting and expensive to produce. As long as the Saudis keep the taps open, both will be squeezed out of the market. Saudi Arabia can afford to keep prices so low for so long it makes no sense to continue oil sands production.”“It is critical that policy makers differentiate between supporting businesses that are suffering in this pandemic, and bailing out businesses that are going through market shifts that industry observers have long predicted.Mr. Manly points to Western Canada Select (WCS), a mix of bitumen and light crude that is currently selling for less than $5 a barrel. “Light crude is worth far more than bitumen so WCS is close to giving bitumen away at this point. West Texas Intermediate is light crude and is selling at $25 per barrel. There should be no bailing out bitumen’s sinking boat. It is expensive to produce so its breakeven point is closer to $35 to $45 a barrel and as high as $60 per barrel for some mines. We need to acknowledge this and invest in the future, which is in renewable energy.”The Green Party’s 2019 Platform outlines a clear and comprehensive strategy to transition towards a zero-carbon economy through the creation of new industries and well-paid jobs. Mission Possible is a just and fair transition plan that demonstrates the path to a stable and prosperous green economy.“We support helping the people of Alberta, the workers and the businesses we will need in the recovery period and beyond,” said Green parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “The whole services sector for oil and gas has transferable skills in a post-carbon economy. We should provide funding for the remediation of the toxic legacy of the oil sands and the clean up of the 100,000 orphaned and abandoned wells in the province. We should support a cross-Canada economic stimulus in retrofitting every building to become carbon negative- producing more energy than it uses. Greens want to support transition jobs for fossil fuel workers, in economic activity that has a chance of building for the future.”The Green Party underscores the importance of substantial investments in renewable energy in Alberta, including converting orphaned wells, where viable, to generate geothermal electricity. Now is the time to begin the transition.\"We should be investing now to not only put money in people\\'s pockets today but to also give them hope for the future,” said Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Support is also needed for Alberta’s farmers, the forestry sector, small businesses and the tourism sector, to ensure that the transition to a new high-tech economy is in place when COVID-19 recedes. Investing in workers and green jobs now means energy workers in every province will thrive in the future in a healthy Canada.\"“To avoid a global climate emergency, which is a far greater threat to humanity than COVID-19, we need to pivot away from fossil fuels, begin a significant Just Transition Strategy for fossil fuel workers and ready the next economic stimulus package to Mission Possible and the Green New Deal,” concluded Ms. May.# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', \"OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is calling for a review of work practices in British Columbia’s oil and gas sector during the on-going COVID-19 crisis.Work on projects such as Coastal GasLink (CGL), the Site C dam, LNG Canada and the Trans Mountain pipeline(TMX) continues, with workers being flown in and out. Green MPs say that these employees, arriving from all over Canada and housed in close quarters in on-site camps, could be seriously jeopardizing their own health as well as the health of nearby Indigenous populations.Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith), who visited Wet’suwet’en territory during the standoff with the RCMP in January, noted that Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs have suspended their community consultation regarding the Coastal GasLink project, to comply with the health authority. The communities are in lock-down and are keeping non-members out.“Air Canada flights have been suspended but the Smithers airport remains open for emergency medical evacuations and charter flights including charters for workers. The Terrace Kitimat airport remains a revolving door for workers coming in from all over the country,” Mr. Manly said.“This is a major threat to northern Indigenous communities. How is it possible that CGL, TMX, LNG and Site C can get an exemption during a health crisis like this, when Canadians are being ordered to self-isolate and maintain physical distance? Oil and gas workers continue to be flown in and out of these communities, potentially carrying in a deadly virus. And it's been noted that the RCMP are still rotating personnel in and out of Wet'suwet'en territory. Many of these communities are woefully underserved when it comes to essential services including healthcare. This has to stop.”On March 18 2020 the B.C. Building Trades Council issued a Statement calling for the scaling down of some major construction projects that house large numbers of workers in remote camps. Executive director Andrew Mercier said: “We need to flatten the curve and alleviate pressure on the rural health care systems.”“This is a crisis in the making,” said Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “It’s unconscionable that Coastal GasLink would seize a moment when the process of Wet’suwet’en internal consultation and governance in response to the agreement achieved with the federal and provincial governments is on hold due to COVID-19, to push forward with construction. It’s also a blatant disregard for the explicit recommendations from our chief medical officers. Putting employees and vulnerable Indigenous populations at risk cannot be tolerated.”On Monday, doctors and mayors in British Columbia’s East Kootenays expressed concern that the Teck Resources camp near Elkford that houses hundreds of employees could be a major risk to spreading COVID-19 in the region. Muskrat Falls, the large hydro project in Newfoundland and Labrador has said it is scaling down operations to protect the safety of labourers and the surrounding communities.“We are navigating uncharted territory with this pandemic,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Indigenous communities are too often on the front lines of these mega-projects. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that all populations are adequately protected, and not subjected to unnecessary risk.

We need to support the most vulnerable.\"Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith) expressed concerns held by the Green caucus. “ We were shocked by the overreach in the first version of the bill,” said Manly. “The initial version was a blank cheque. The Bill that was finally passed was much improved. We could live with it, but we still think the Emergencies Act could have been used instead. And we may still need it.”“The Emergencies Act gives the government the ‘authorization to make emergency payments’ and has all the oversight tools required for the proper checks and balances needed in a parliamentary democracy.

But limiting that subsidy to 10 percent of the worker’s wage doesn't go nearly far enough” , said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith). “A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses (CFIB) paints a bleak picture of the reality facing most Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).”“Small business owners are having to make agonizing choices. With the majority facing a drastic drop in sales due to enforced closures, how can SMEs retain staff? We would like to see the government follow the lead of some Western European countries who are offering business wage subsidies of 75 to 90 per cent.”Mr. Manly said that companies in Denmark that retain employees qualify for a 75 per cent government wage subsidy and supplement the difference.“The higher subsidy would mean that employers do not have to temporarily lay off the workers, significantly reducing the numbers applying for Employment Insurance (EI). Last week over 500,000 Canadians applied for Ei, a figure that is bound to rise as the COVID-19 emergency continues. In downtown Nanaimo,businesses are being boarded up and I am sure this is happening in other communities across the country.“The CFIB survey, conducted between March 13 - 16, 2020 concluded that 50 percent of small businesses have experienced a drop in sales, 40 percent of those experiencing a drop of 25 per cent or more. Amongst other findings, the survey showed that the sectors most negatively affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19 are hospitality, tourism, artsrecreation, retail and personal services.“If we keep adding to the EI applications we will end up with unemployment numbers not seen since the Great Depression ,” said Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “A robust wage-subsidy program is our best protection against that.”“The Business Council of Canada said last week that Canada needs to reframe the way we’re thinking about stimulus (into) a job preservation program. If we can support SMEs with robust wage subsidies that allow them to keep employees on payroll, it will also aid in the economic recovery once this pandemic is over.”“On the East Coast as we head into what would be normally prime tourist season operators are faced not only with lost revenue but also having to lay off the staff they need to maintain their businesses. Many of these employees have years of experience and without them these small businesses will disappear. A wage subsidy would be a lifeline.” says Interim Green Party Leader, Jo-Ann RobertsGreen Party President and shadow cabinet small business critic Jean-Luc Cooke noted: “This is not 2008, nor comparable to other recent shocks - this is hitting home and it is hitting hard. Any stimulus to small business today will feed directly into the home and the necessities every Canadian needs.”# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca\", 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada is making changes to its leadership contest rules in light of COVID-19.Interim Leader, Jo-Ann Roberts, said: “The challenges faced by all Canadians - including the thousands of GPC members and supporters are very real. We have heard from our members and our leadership contestants and we want you to know we have heard you. We want to make sure our rules are not adding extra pressure or putting anyone’s health at risk. We are not suspending the leadership contest at this time because we realize how important leadership is during a crisis and this is an opportunity for those seeking this position to demonstrate their values to members in this difficult time.”The first change is that the 100 signatures required for a candidate’s nomination can now be collected electronically. The digital nomination process allows all contestants to continue with their applications virtually.“Many of our contestants have already moved their campaigns on-line and are making good use of social media tools,” Roberts added. “We also realize these are difficult times for many people. To reflect that reality, we are lowering the fundraising goal for the ‘second gate’ of the leadership process.”Originally, there was a fee of $40,000 due at the end of July. This requirement has been reduced to $30,000 and the party will continue to monitor this goal as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. The deadline for applications remains June 3.“At this point we have not cancelled our convention on Oct 2-4 in Charlottetown,” said Ms. Roberts.“However, that remains a possibility if members are not able to travel or gather in large groups. For that reason we will not be opening registration for the convention until late May or early June.”There continues to be strong interest in the leadership contest with six publicly announced candidates Annamie Paul, Alex Tyrrell, Amita Kuttner, David Merner, Dimitri Lascaris and Judy Green. At least three others have requested applications.# # #For more information or to arrange an interview:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca', 'OTTAWA – The Green Party of Canada welcomes the financial support to Canadians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic announced by the Trudeau administration in Ottawa today.“We’re grateful to the government for announcing substantial measures that will provide Canadians with some financial comfort during these distressing and uncertain times,” said Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands). “The commitment is there. It’s so important that no one should be afraid to stay home due to financial worries. In order to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, we must support people who are unable to work due to self isolation, or because they must stay home to look after loved ones. For part-time and self employed workers, those in the gig economy, small business owners watching their revenues dry up, these measures will provide much needed reassurance.”While the Green caucus is encouraged by today’s announcements, one area that they hope will soon be addressed is support for Canadian farmers.“It’s encouraging that financial support is being put in place for the large numbers of Canadian workers who don’t qualify for Employment Insurance,” said Paul Manly (MP, Nanaimo-Ladysmith) “The new measures announced today aimed at helping small businesses retain their employees, are also positive steps. One area that specifically concerns me though is food production. We have a looming crisis in agriculture. We need a relief package for farmers, and we must find solutions for farmers who rely on temporary foreign workers. We cannot let our local and regional food production supply chains fail, we urgently need to protect them.”Green caucus critic for Crown-Indigenous Relations and Indigenous Services Jenica Atwin (MP, Fredericton) was encouraged that $305 million will be dedicated to a new Inidgenous Community Support Fund. “First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities are particularly vulnerable at this time,” said Ms. Atwin. “These funds will help, and we’ll continue to monitor the situation to ensure that sufficient funding will be made available throughout this crisis. I was also pleased to see that there will be funding for homeless shelters and for those escaping gender-based violence.”“There are so many frontline workers to whom we are grateful,” said Green Party Interim Leader Jo-Ann Roberts. “Whether they be healthcare professionals, those keeping our pharmacies and food stores stocked or essential service workers, they are all helping to keep us safe and strong. Knowing that our food and medical supplies are readily available will help curb hoarding, thereby ensuring that people can get the supplies that they need.“I greatly appreciate that some of our parliamentary colleagues have listened to suggestions from our caucus and am encouraged by the cross-party collaboration. We know that many Canadians will still have questions and concerns, and we will continue to advocate on their behalf. Canadians are a resilient people, joining forces in so many different ways to help each other. Today our government stepped up to provide them with a much needed financial support package, and we applaud that,” concluded Ms. May.# # #For more information, or to arrange an interview contact:Rosie EmeryPress Secretary613-562-4916x206rosie.emery@greenparty.ca']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q2ULm1Q1GWRm","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The next two sections:\n","    a) takes the content lists and brings them into a pandas dataframe\n","    b) writes the dateframe to csv"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"uymhUAACGWRo","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1593488468045,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":887,"user":{"displayName":"Colin MacDonald","photoUrl":"","userId":"12433864698816465933"}},"outputId":"432d46a0-c625-4a40-a497-cdc8bd584e9e"},"source":["scrape_output = pd.DataFrame({'Date': date_list, 'Header': header_list, 'Content': content_list, 'Link': url_list})\n","print(scrape_output)"],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["              Date  ...
